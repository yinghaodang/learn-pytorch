# Learn classic network by pytorch

I created this repository on November 18, 2024. The inspiration came from a classmate who sent me an assignment. The task involved using an LSTM network to train a model for recognizing digits from 0 to 9. I had never studied this network before, nor had I used CTC loss, so I became interested.

Previously, I had been focusing on the structural differences between Qwen2 in the Transformer library and vllm, aiming to transfer these transformation patterns to new models. This made me realize that my foundational knowledge was somewhat lacking. After completing this assignment, I hope to place greater emphasis on classical network structures.
